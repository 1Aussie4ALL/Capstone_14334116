# MRI Detection and Brain Tumor Classification System

This enhanced system addresses the issue where the original model would incorrectly classify non-MRI images as one of the tumor types. The new system implements a two-stage classification approach:

1. **First Stage**: Determine if the input image is an MRI scan or not
2. **Second Stage**: If it's an MRI, classify the type of brain tumor

## Problem Solved

The original model was trained only on MRI images (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor), so when you input a random non-MRI image (like a car, cat, or landscape), it would incorrectly try to classify it into one of these medical categories instead of recognizing that it's not an MRI scan at all.

## New Features

- **MRI Detection**: The model now includes a `not_mri` class to distinguish between medical scans and other images
- **Two-Stage Classification**: First detects if the image is an MRI, then classifies the tumor type
- **Balanced Dataset**: Includes diverse non-MRI images to improve training
- **Enhanced Training**: Better data augmentation and model architecture

## Files Created

1. **`train_mri_detector.py`** - Main training script for the enhanced model
2. **`predict_mri_detection.py`** - Prediction script using the new model
3. **`add_non_mri_images.py`** - Script to add diverse non-MRI images to the dataset
4. **`run_mri_detection_training.bat`** - Batch file to run training
5. **`run_mri_detection_prediction.bat`** - Batch file to run prediction
6. **`add_non_mri_images.bat`** - Batch file to add non-MRI images

## How to Use

### Step 1: Add Non-MRI Images to Dataset

First, run the script to add diverse non-MRI images to your training dataset:

```bash
# Option 1: Run the batch file
run_non_mri_images.bat

# Option 2: Run directly with Python
python add_non_mri_images.py
```

This will:
- Download 40+ diverse non-MRI images (animals, vehicles, people, nature, buildings, objects, food, technology)
- Create variations (rotated, flipped) for better training
- Add images to both training and testing sets
- Ensure dataset balance

### Step 2: Train the Enhanced Model

Train the new model that can distinguish between MRI and non-MRI images:

```bash
# Option 1: Run the batch file
run_mri_detection_training.bat

# Option 2: Run directly with Python
python train_mri_detector.py
```

This will:
- Load your existing MRI dataset (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor)
- Add the new `not_mri` class
- Train a VGG16-based model with 5 classes instead of 4
- Save the model as `mri_detection_classifier.h5`

### Step 3: Use the Enhanced Model for Prediction

Use the new model to classify images:

```bash
# Option 1: Run the batch file
run_mri_detection_prediction.bat

# Option 2: Run directly with Python
python predict_mri_detection.py
```

## How It Works

### Training Process

1. **Dataset Preparation**: 
   - Original MRI classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor
   - New class: `not_mri` (diverse non-MRI images)

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Based on VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet
   - 5 output classes (4 MRI + 1 non-MRI)
   - Transfer learning with fine-tuning

3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Rotation, scaling, flipping
   - Helps the model generalize better

### Prediction Process

1. **Input**: Any image (MRI or non-MRI)
2. **Stage 1**: Model determines if it's an MRI scan
3. **Stage 2**: If MRI, classifies tumor type; if not MRI, confirms it's not a medical scan

## Expected Results

### For MRI Images:
- High confidence in one of the 4 MRI classes
- Low probability for `not_mri` class

### For Non-MRI Images:
- High confidence in `not_mri` class
- Low probabilities for all MRI classes
- Clear indication that the image is not a medical scan

## Example Output

```
Prediction Results:
Predicted class: not_mri
Confidence: 95.67%

Class probabilities:
  glioma: 0.02%
  meningioma: 0.01%
  notumor: 0.01%
  pituitary: 0.01%
  not_mri: 95.67%

Interpretation: This image is NOT an MRI scan.
The model detected that this is not a medical brain scan image.
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Classification**: No more false positives for non-MRI images
2. **Medical Safety**: Prevents misdiagnosis of non-medical images
3. **Robust Detection**: Handles various types of non-MRI images
4. **Professional Use**: Suitable for medical applications where accuracy is critical

## Requirements

Make sure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python pillow requests matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Model not found**: Ensure you've run the training script first
2. **Poor performance**: Check that the `not_mri` class has enough diverse images
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce batch size in training if needed

### Performance Tips:

1. **More non-MRI images**: Add more diverse non-MRI images for better training
2. **Data augmentation**: The training script includes augmentation, but you can modify parameters
3. **Model fine-tuning**: Unfreeze more layers in the base model for better performance

## Next Steps

After training the enhanced model:

1. **Test with various images**: Try different types of non-MRI images
2. **Validate performance**: Check confusion matrix and classification report
3. **Fine-tune if needed**: Adjust training parameters based on results
4. **Deploy**: Use the model in your medical imaging application

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all required packages are installed
2. Ensure your dataset structure is correct
3. Verify that the training completed successfully
4. Check the console output for error messages

The enhanced system should now properly distinguish between MRI and non-MRI images, providing accurate and reliable classification for medical applications.
